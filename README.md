# CryptoTracker
This Python project is a web scraper that fetches the name and current price of a specified cryptocurrency from a popular cryptocurrency tracking website. The script continuously monitors the website and updates the displayed price at regular intervals, providing real-time price information for the selected cryptocurrency.

The script basically pulls the information out of a crypto website and stores it in an Excel file. Then proceeds to run the script again after 60 seconds and updates the price in the file.
